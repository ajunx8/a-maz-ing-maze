# The Challenge

## Build a small application with the following components:
FastAPI backend – Create an API with a couple of endpoints. It should handle:
User registration/login (JWT or similar auth flow)
A “maze puzzle” endpoint where a user submits a path (set of moves) and the backend validates whether it reaches the goal.
Use OpenAPI/Swagger for documentation.

## PostgreSQL database – Store users, puzzles, and attempts (including whether the attempt was valid). Seed it with at least 2–3 puzzles.

## React frontend 
Show a list of puzzles.
Allow a user to “play” one (basic grid or simple interface).
Submit their moves to the backend and display the result.
Include a simple leaderboard or results page.

## Key Points
Make the puzzle logic fun: users must collect keys before opening doors, avoid walls, and can use portals.
Keep it simple, but ensure the logic works correctly on the server-side.
Add some testing (unit tests or component tests).
Please use Git and include a short README file explaining the setup, your approach, and where you utilised AI assistance (if applicable).

## What to Deliver
A GitHub (or similar) repo link with your code.
Instructions to run the project (Docker or simple setup scripts welcome).
We’re looking at:
How you structure and document your code.
How you approach problem-solving and puzzle logic.
How well you use FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React, and testing.

Please aim to complete as much of this as possible in advance of your final round interview. I will send out a calendar link to book a call with us for next week, providing an opportunity to showcase your work above.  If you need more time to implement the above, please let me know?
